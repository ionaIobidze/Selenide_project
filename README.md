# Selenide Project N1

## Overview
This project is done using Selenide, TestNG, and SQL Express. It tests the Swoop.ge website and the SauceDemo login page. The Page Object Model and the fluent API are used in the code. The final report is automatically generated by Allure, which is uploaded in the allure-report folder. 

## Skills Demonstrated
- Test Automation: Implemented automated test cases using Selenide.
- TestNG: Used TestNG for managing and executing test cases.
- Data-Driven Testing: Applied data providers for parameterized testing.
- Database Interaction: Executed SQL scripts and interacted with a database to manage test data.
- Continuous Integration: Structured tests for integration into a CI pipeline.

## Tools and Libraries Used
- Selenide: For browser automation.
- TestNG: For test management and execution.
- Java: Programming language for writing test scripts.
- SQL Express: For database operations and validation.
